CMP rewrite of [Nekome](https://github.com/Chesire/Nekome)

Currently runs on Android and JVM, will work on iOS in the future.

APIs used:

- [Kitsu](https://kitsu.app) for tracking anime and library management
- [Jikan](https://jikan.moe) for finding airing shows
- [anime-lists](https://github.com/Fribb/anime-lists) for mapping between Kitsu, MyAnimeList and
  AniList ids

Note: The application is mostly just being thrown together, actual structure, development practices,
tests etc will come later.
